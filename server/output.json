We want to get you as quickly as possible to the point where you can write useful programs, and to do that we have to concentrate on the basics: variables and constants, arithmetic, control flow, functions, and the rudiments of input and output. We are intentionally leaving out of this chapter features of C that are important for writing bigger programs. <br>In any case, experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate from the material in this chapter 'to their own programming needs. Beginners should supplement it by writing small, similar programs of their own<br><br><b>Learning Objectives:</b><ol><li>Identify the purpose of core elements of the programming.</li><li>Explain the input reading and output formatting that can be done using input and output statements.</li><li>Learn how to repeat a set of statements using for loop.</li><li>Learn the scope of variables based on their declaration and the storage classes.</li><li>Identify which part of the code can be modularise to improve readability.</li></ol>","id":1,"name":"Tutorial Introduction","content":[{"activity_json":[{"activityType":"notes","title":"A tutorial introduction and Getting Started","text":"<b>Prerequisities:</b><ol><li> Students have to have an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Stable version) on their machines</li><li> Make sure that the students will have a GCC compiler installed on their machines</li></ol> <br>Read the Chapter - 1 from the textbook The C Programming Language - Second Edition (Page Number: 5)<br> Textbook link:<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bKeZEOqqvDK2HPKc6kRQFLY6v1VzaGtA/view?usp=sharing\">Textbook</a>"}],"activity_name":"A tutorial introduction and Getting Started","module_id":1},{"activity_json":[{"activityType":"quiz","evaluate":false,"questions":[{"correct_feedback":"Correct","max_marks":"1","options":[{"correct":true,"option":"Statements that specify the computing operations to be done and variables store values used during the computation"},{"correct":false,"option":"Variables that specify the computing operations to be done and functions store values used during the computation"},{"correct":true,"option":"Variables and Statements constitute together a function"},{"correct":false,"option":"Only statements that specify the computing operations"}],"questionText":[{"text":"A function consists of: (Check all that apply)"}],"questionType":"checkbox","wrong_feedback":"Incorrect"},{"correct_feedback":"Correct","max_marks":"1","options":[{"correct":false,"option":"Character String"},{"correct":true,"option":"Character Array"},{"correct":true,"option":"String constant"},{"correct":true,"option":"String Literal"}],"questionText":[{"text":"The sequence of characters \"hello, world\n\" is called as (Check all that apply)"}],"questionType":"checkbox","wrong_feedback":"Incorrect"},{"correct_feedback":"Correct","max_marks":"1","options":[{"correct":false,"option":"Main"},{"correct":false,"option":"Start"},{"correct":true,"option":"main()"},{"correct":false,"option":"None of the above"}],"questionText":[{"text":"A _______  function that will call other functions to start the execution of the program.

The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.<br><br>An operating system is software that manages the computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system<br><br>Early computers allowed only one program to be executed at a time. This program had complete control of the system and had access to all the system’s resources. In contrast, contemporary computer systems allow multiple programs to be loaded into memory and executed concurrently. This evolution required firmer control and more compartmentalization of the various programs; and these needs resulted in the notion of a process, which is a program in execution. A process is the unit of work in a modern time-sharing system.<br><br><b>Learning Objectives:</b><ol><li>To describe the basic organization of computer systems.</li><li>To provide a grand tour of the major components of operating systems.</li><li>To give an overview of the many types of computing environments.</li><li>To explore several open-source operating systems</li><li>To introduce the notion of a process—a program in execution, which forms the basis of all computation.</li><li>To describe the various features of processes, including scheduling, creation, and termination.</li><li>To explore interprocess communication using shared memory and message passing.</li><li>To describe communication in client–server systems.</li><li>Understand and trace the assembly code.","id":6,"name":"OS Concepts, Bomb Lab Diffuse of Phase - 1","content":[{"activity_json":[{"activityType":"notes","title":"Introduction","text":"Refer to the slides from 1 to 33 and skim through the rest of the slides - from chapter - 01 Introduction.<br><br>You can also read the textbook Chapter 1 - Introduction.

Pointers are much used in C, partly ,because they are sometimes the only way to express a computation, and partly because they usually lead to more compact and efficient code than can be obtained in other ways. Pointers and arrays are closely related; this chapter also explores this relationship and shows how to exploit it.

We start with exceptions, which lie at the intersection of the hardware and the operating system. We also discuss system calls, which are exceptions that provide applications with entry points into the operating system.
