What you do when things get tough? In the course you will learn the differences between machine intelligence and human intelligence. You will understand why AI fails and when. AI does not have a narrow limited working memory (a.k.a., short-term memory) but we humans do. How does our working memory make us more intelligent than machines? Why do we understand the world and machines don't? You will also learn fundamental theorems for machine learning and see how they apply to machine intelligence and human intelligence.",
